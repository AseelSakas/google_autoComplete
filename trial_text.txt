 the governor of Lajjun Ahmad Turabay.

In the 1740s ten Jewish households under the spiritual leadership
 of Rabbi Soloman Abadi settled in Kafr Yasif and were joined 
by a number of other Jews, leaving Safad in the early 1760s as 
a result of the Near East earthquakes of 1759. According to Jewish 
travelers, the Jews in Kafr Yasif lived well under the
 auspices of Arab Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous Ottoman
 ruler of the Galilee whose tolerance had allowed
 for the initial establishment of the village's Jewish community.

In April 1938, during the Arab revolt
 in Palestine, a group of Palestinian Arab 
rebels planted a mine on the road near
 Kafr Yasif which blew up a British vehicle
 killing nine soldiers (according to the Arabs) or one soldier 
and wounding two others (according to the British)
 The British Army proceeded to start setting Kafr Yasif
 ablaze in retaliation, but were then informed by local
 residents that Kuwaykat's inhabitants were responsible
 for the attack. The British troops fatally shot nine Arabs
 as they approached the village.[27] Between 14–17 February
 1939, the British Army set between 68 and 72 homes ablaze in
 Kafr Yasif in response to another mine attack on British soldiers
 driving on a newly constructed security road which resulted
 in the death of one soldier and the wounding of two others
[27] It was later discovered by the British authorities 
that the attackers were not from Kafr Yasif
In compensation, the town was rebuilt by the British
 with a school and a city hall which are still in use today

 were very eager to point out that the troops who destroyed 
their houses were not English but Irish."[28]

On 8–14 July 1948, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War,
 the Carmeli Brigade and the 7th Armored Brigade
 occupied Kafr Yasif as part of the first stage of Operation
 Dekel.[34] Unlike in many captured Arab towns, the majority
 of the population did not flee, and about 700 inhabitants
 of nearby villages, especially al-Birwa, al-Manshiyya and 
Kuwaykat, took refuge there. On 28 February 1949, most
 of them were put into trucks[by whom?] and driven to the
 front lines, where they were forced to cross the frontier
 border into Lebanon.[35][36] On 1 March another 250 
refugees were deported.[37] Knesset member Tawfik Toubi
 strongly protested these expulsions.[38]

Kafr Yasif is one of the few Arab towns in the Galilee that
 retained most of the land it held before 1948.[39]

 1952–3.[40] On 5 June 1951 the Israeli government 
reactivated the local council in the only example of an
 Arab local council that continuously existed after 1948.[25] In the first elections, held in 1954, 
the former mayor Yani Yani was re-elected 
mayor as head of a Communist Party and 
Nationalist Group (Kafr Yassif List) coalition, defeating the
 Mapai candidate.[41] Yani remained in 
office until his death in 1962.[25] He 
became leader of the Arab Popular Front which evolved into the Al Ard movement. The APF campaigned 
for the protection of Waqf properties in Israel
, Violet Khoury was elected mayor of Kafr Yasif
making her the first Arab woman to head a
 local council in Israel.[43] The population remained under martial law until 1966.

The first meeting of the Congress of Druze
 Intellectuals took place in Kafr Yasif on 
26 August 1966. The initiative behind the 
formation of the congress came from the youth
 of Druze villages in the Galilee, led by Salman Faraj
. When the Druze leadership in the Department of Minority
 Affairs gained knowledge of the congress's planned meeting 
and failed to persuade Faraj to postpone it, the spiritual head
 of the Druze community, Sheikh Amin Tarif, locked the gates 
of the al-Khadr Shrine, where the meeting was to be held
The congress was instead held in a nearby house in the town
 and one of the clauses of the summit expressed Druze 
solidarity with the other Arab communities of Israel

Kafr Yasif became the site of the first major 
violent incident between Christians and Druze
 in Israel on 11 April 1981. The clash began

 local team and that of the nearby Druze village 
of Julis; a young man from Julis was fatally stabbed
 by a Christian from Kafr Yasif. Although
